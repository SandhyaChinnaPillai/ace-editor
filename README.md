# ace-editor
json editor using ace in apex language in visualforce

I have used salesforce objects for autocomplete 
for example : User can start typing ac - and account and other objects containing ac in their name fire up in autocomplete ,
autocomplete on dot trigger is also enabled .

account.b = fields related to account and starting with b appears in the list.

There is a button to edit snippets too . User can create his own reusable snippets on the go .
snippets are 2 or more pies of lines of code that are repeatedly used . It can also be complex names . Snippets and autocomplete goes hand in hand.
Once user starts typing a snippet name then autocomplete suggests that snippet , tab trigger is also enabled.
